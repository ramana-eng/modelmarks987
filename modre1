////
////This code uses the File class to create a File object representing the 
//folder whose contents you want to list. It then calls the listFiles() method on 
//that object to get an array of all the files in the folder. It then uses a for loop to 
//iterate over the array and print the names of all the files in the folder using 
//the getName() method.
////
////It also check if the current file is a file or directory
//using isFile() method, so that only files are printed.
////
////Please note that you need to replace the path/to/folder with the actual path of the folder.
